    <p>Pseudo-classes match elements based on certain states.</p>
    <p>For example, the a (anchor) element can have the following four states: link, visited, hover, and active</p>
  </div>
  <div class="article">
    <p> “first-child” pseudo-class. This pseudo-class does match elements based on their position in the element tree, but is
      still considered a pseudo-class because the fact that an element is the first child of its parent is considered an
      arbitrary state. </p>
    <p>The first-child pseudo-class is usually combined with a tag or class selector</p>
